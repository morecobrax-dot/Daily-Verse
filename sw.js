/* Service worker — offline support for the application shell.
 *
 * CACHE_NAME is DERIVED, not chosen. It is written here by
 * `npm run config:sync` from APP_CONFIG.id and the newest APP_UPDATES entry
 * in index.html, and `npm run config:verify` fails if the two ever drift.
 * Never hand-edit it: the cache name is what separates this app from every
 * other app deployed on the same origin, and a stale one serves old code.
 *
 * Publishing a new version means adding an APP_UPDATES entry and running
 * config:sync. That bumps the version, the cache name changes, and phones
 * pick up the new code.
 *
 * This only ever caches application CODE. Everything a person creates lives
 * in localStorage under the app's own namespace and is never touched here —
 * clearing these caches cannot lose a single record.
